# 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://sdmtr.github.io/2048/)

Find out more at the [original 2048 repository](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

### Replays

As you play, the replay textarea fills up with a code you can share with other players. To replay someone else's code, just paste it into the textarea and click the play button.

You can pause replay at any point. If you click the stop button while a replay is running or paused, the current replay is truncated and you can continue playing from that point.

This doesn't work on mobile because I don't know how to debug javascript on mobile Safari :)
